# Docker Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the complete Docker integration into LibGo, transforming it from a KVM-only management system into a unified compute platform that manages both VMs and containers.

## Architecture Changes

### Unified Compute Layer
- Created `internal/compute/` package with abstraction for both VMs and containers
- Implemented `ComputeManager` that coordinates multiple backends
- Added backend registration system for pluggable compute providers
- Standardized resource management across different virtualization technologies

### Docker Backend Implementation
Created complete Docker integration in `internal/docker/`:

1. **Manager Layer** (`manager.go`, `client_manager.go`)
   - Connection pool management for Docker clients
   - Retry logic and error handling
   - Health checking and monitoring

2. **Service Implementations**
   - **Container Service** (`container/`): Full lifecycle management
   - **Image Service** (`image/`): Image pull, build, tag, remove
   - **Network Service** (`network/`): Network creation and management
   - **Volume Service** (`volume/`): Persistent storage management

3. **Backend Service** (`backend.go`)
   - Implements the compute backend interface
   - Converts between Docker and unified compute models
   - Handles Docker-specific operations

## API Enhancements

### New Unified Compute API (`/api/v1/compute/*`)
- `GET /instances` - List all compute instances (VMs and containers)
- `POST /instances` - Create new instance with backend selection
- `GET /instances/:id` - Get instance details
- `PUT /instances/:id` - Update instance configuration
- `DELETE /instances/:id` - Delete instance
- `PUT /instances/:id/start` - Start instance
- `PUT /instances/:id/stop` - Stop instance
- `PUT /instances/:id/restart` - Restart instance
- `GET /instances/:id/usage` - Get resource usage
- `GET /cluster/status` - Overall cluster status
- `GET /backends/:backend/info` - Backend information

### Docker-Specific APIs (`/api/v1/docker/*`)
Implemented comprehensive Docker management endpoints:

1. **Container Endpoints**
   - Create, start, stop, restart, pause, unpause, remove
   - Execute commands, view logs, monitor stats
   - File operations (copy to/from container)

2. **Image Endpoints**
   - List, pull, inspect, remove images
   - Prune unused images

3. **Network Endpoints**
   - Create, list, inspect, remove networks
   - Connect/disconnect containers

4. **Volume Endpoints**
   - Create, list, inspect, remove volumes
   - Prune unused volumes

## Configuration Enhancements

Added new configuration sections:

```yaml
# Docker configuration
docker:
  enabled: true
  host: "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
  apiVersion: "1.41"
  tlsVerify: false
  requestTimeout: 30s
  connectionTimeout: 10s
  maxRetries: 3
  retryDelay: 1s

# Unified compute configuration
compute:
  defaultBackend: "kvm"
  allowMixedDeployments: true
  resourceLimits:
    maxInstances: 100
    maxCPUCores: 64
    maxMemoryGB: 256
    maxStorageGB: 2000
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Docker Client Compatibility
- Resolved Docker v28+ compatibility issues with Go 1.24
- Added `github.com/pkg/errors` for backward compatibility
- Fixed deprecated API usage (types.Container â†’ container.Summary, etc.)

### Service Architecture
Each Docker service follows the pattern:
1. Interface definition with all operations
2. Implementation with proper error handling and logging
3. Integration with the Docker manager for client access
4. Comprehensive API handlers

### Error Handling
- Standardized error responses across all services
- Backend-specific error codes
- Proper error propagation from Docker daemon

### Testing
- Created basic test structure for services
- Mock implementations for unit testing
- Integration points for future comprehensive testing

## Benefits of the Integration

1. **Unified Management**: Single API for both VMs and containers
2. **Flexibility**: Choose the right backend for each workload
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Run lightweight containers alongside full VMs
4. **Operational Simplicity**: Consistent operations regardless of backend
5. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Unified metrics and logging
6. **Future Extensibility**: Easy to add more backends (Podman, Firecracker, etc.)

## Migration Path

For existing users:
- KVM-only deployments continue to work unchanged
- Docker can be enabled via configuration
- Gradual migration possible with mixed workloads
- APIs remain backward compatible

## Security Considerations

- JWT authentication applies to all Docker operations
- Role-based access control for sensitive operations
- Docker socket access requires proper permissions
- TLS support for remote Docker daemons

## Performance Optimizations

- Connection pooling for Docker clients
- Efficient resource usage tracking
- Minimal overhead for unified API layer
- Async operations where appropriate

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for expansion:
- Docker Compose support
- Kubernetes integration
- Multi-node cluster support
- Advanced networking (overlay networks)
- GPU passthrough for containers
- Container image building pipeline
