# Frontend Blank Page Debug Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

1. **TypeScript Compilation Errors**
   - Fixed import errors in `network.ts` and `storage.ts` - changed from named imports to default import of `apiClient`
   - Fixed `progressEvent` type annotation in `storage.ts`
   - Fixed all navigation calls to use TanStack Router's proper syntax: `navigate({ to: '/path' })` instead of `navigate('/path')`
   - Fixed `useParams` calls to use TanStack Router's API: `useParams({ from: '/route/$param' })`

2. **Backend Connection Issue**
   - The frontend is running on port 3701 (3700 was in use)
   - The backend server appears to have issues starting on port 8080
   - Frontend is trying to proxy API calls to backend but getting connection refused

## Current Status

The TypeScript compilation errors have been resolved and the build is successful. However, the blank page issue is likely due to:

1. **Backend not running properly** - The backend server failed to start because port 8080 is already in use
2. **Authentication redirect** - The frontend likely redirects to login page when it can't reach the backend

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Fix the backend server:**
   ```bash
   # Kill the process using port 8080
   sudo lsof -i :8080 | grep LISTEN | awk '{print $2}' | xargs -r sudo kill -9
   
   # Or use a different port in the backend config
   # Edit configs/config.yaml to use a different port
   
   # Restart the backend
   make stop-backend
   make start-backend
   ```

2. **Access the frontend:**
   - The frontend is now running on `http://localhost:3701` (not 3700)
   - Once the backend is running, the frontend should work properly

3. **Check browser console:**
   - Open browser developer tools (F12)
   - Check the Console tab for any JavaScript errors
   - Check the Network tab to see if API calls are failing
